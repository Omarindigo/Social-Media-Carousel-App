# Social-Media-Carousel-App
Social Media Carousel App for mocking and low fedility 


This web application serves as a mock Social Media Story Carousel, simulating the appearance and functionality of social media posts when published on a website. It provides a responsive and accessible interface where users can navigate through various media, including images and videos, using both on-screen controls and keyboard inputs. The design ensures that media content is displayed consistently across different devices, from desktops to mobile screens.

The application is built with modern web technologies. The frontend utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly carousel experience. Accessibility is a key focus, with ARIA roles and labels integrated to support screen readers. Additionally, a modal is included to guide users on interacting with the carousel, covering keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures.

On the backend, the application is powered by Node.js with Express.js, which serves media files dynamically from a structured public directory. This backend setup mimics a live server environment, offering a realistic preview of how social media content would be delivered and displayed on a functioning website. Overall, this application offers a professional demonstration of how social media stories will look and behave once deployed.
